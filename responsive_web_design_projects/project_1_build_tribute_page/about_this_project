The first project I should create a tribute page. The instructions say that we should use just ID's in the tags.
So my HTML file is with just ID's names and not CLASSES name, as my CSS file as well because that was one of the
requirements from the project. Another requirement is to do anything simple with Javascript, so I created an ALERT
box if the user wants more information about the person in the Tribute Page.
